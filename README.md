## Hello World - Hardcore Mode

PME is nearly finished perfecting his masterpiece, but he needs a sample of hello world in all the languages in the world!

## How can I help?!

PME, although boasts about knowing so many languages, actually only knows a few, and he wanted to see how all the languages looked like.

## What do you mean by a sample of hello world?

It must be a unique version of hello world in your chosen language. The language you choose must be one that has not been done by another fellow contributor.

***TEMPLATE***

Your file must ask for their name, with `Enter your name: `, and then use that input to respond with `Hello x!`, replacing `x` with their name.

Here is an example of what you could do. Python is already taken.

```python
# By RPME - https://github.com/Programmerme

name = input('Enter your name: ')
print("Hello",name+"!")
```

## RULES 

1. Your submission must be in the `first-program` directory `first-program/hello_langaugename.{language}`
2. Your submission must NOT be a duplicate of someone else's submission. It MUST be UNIQUE (the language MUST be UNIQUE, the sample MUST be UNIQUE).
3. Make sure to say who made it at the top of the file, using a comment.
4. The submissions are all checked automatically, if it fails because your response is wrong, then you're not following the template.
5. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, while loops that never end, CPU Monero Miners)

6. No ADS (No advertising your product, No third party ads)
7. DO NOT MODIFY OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBMISSIONS. THESE PRS WILL BE INSTANTLY DENIED AND MARKED SPAM.

## But why is this a challenge?

The point of this challenge is to prove that you know how to code in coding languages, rather than simple HTML.
***THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE FROM THIS CHALLENGE IS A BUNCH OF GENERIC HELLO WORLD FILES***

## Final note

Remember to check that your codes work by testing it beforehand! The template provided is VERY strict, you must follow the exact template in order to be merged.


# First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice environment? This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

#### *If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.]( #tutorials-using-other-tools )*




<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
where "url you just copied" (without the quote marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/nss-cucek.git
```
where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository in GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd nss-cucek
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b add-notification-nss
```
(The name of the branch does not need to have the word *add* in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="assets/git-status.png" alt="git status" />


If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.


Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```
replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Congrats!  You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> PR_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!




Now let's get you started with contributing to other projects. We've compiled a list of projects with easy issues you can get started on.
